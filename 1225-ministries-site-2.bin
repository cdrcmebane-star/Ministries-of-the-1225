Apostle Johnny M. Quarles
Prophetess Joann Quarles

At 1225 Ministries, we believe every person has been named by God and carries divine significance. Our mission is not to build monuments, but movements—fueled by intimacy with God and marked by prophetic and apostolic power.

Vision Statement 

To awaken, restore, and release a generation of leaders who know they are beloved by God, speak with prophetic clarity, and walk in apostolic authority.

We envision a global move where identity is not shaped by the world, but by the fire of God’s word—naming the next generation Jedidiah, the beloved of the Lord.

Mission Statement Speak prophetic identity into individuals who feel disqualified, forgotten, or broken. Train and equip believers to walk in apostolic boldness, spiritual maturity, and divine purpose. Restore destiny through healing, truth, and the power of the Holy Spirit. Raise a generation marked not by religion, but by divine intimacy and kingdom assignment. Be a voice like Nathan—confronting with truth, but restoring with fire. Contact
